# Overmind

> Web application development is about **defining**, **changing** and **consuming state** to produce a user experience. Overmind aims for a developer experience where that is all you focus on, reducing the orchestration of state management to a minimum. Making you a **happier** and more **productive** developer!

## APPLICATION INSIGHT

Develop the application state, effects and actions without leaving [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or use the standalone development tool. Everything that happens in your app is tracked and you can seamlessly code and run logic to verify that everything works as expected without necessarily having to implement UI.

## A SINGLE STATE TREE

Building your application with a single state tree is the most straight forward mental model. You get a complete overview, but can still organize the state by namespacing it into domains. This gives you the benefit of being able to explore all the state of your application from a single point. With Typescript it is even documented. The devtools allows you to edit and mock out state.

```typescript
{
  isAuthenticating: false,
  dashboard: {
    issues: [],
    selectedIssueId: null,
  },
  user: null,
  form: new Form()
}
```

## SEPARATION OF LOGIC

Separate 3rd party APIs and logic not specific to your application by using **effects**. This will keep your application logic pure and without low level APIs cluttering your code.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="api.js" %}
```javascript
export const fetchItems = async () {
    const response = await fetch('/api/items')

    return response.json()
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="actions.js" %}
```typescript
export const loadApp = ({ state, effects }) => {
  state.items = await effects.api.fetchItems()
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## SAFE AND PREDICTABLE CHANGES

When you build applications that perform many state changes things can get out of hand. In Overmind you can only perform state changes from **actions** and all changes are tracked by the development tool. Even effects and reactions are tracked.

```javascript
export const getItems = async ({ state, effects }) => {
  state.isLoadingItems = true
  state.items = await effects.api.fetchItems()
  state.isLoadingItems = false
}
```

## COMPLEXITY TOOLS

Even though Overmind can create applications with plain **state** and **actions**, you can use **opt-in** tools like **functional operators**,**, statemachines** and state values defined as a **class,** to manage complexities of your application.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Operators" %}
```javascript
export const search = pipe(
  mutate(({ state }, query) => {
    state.query = query
  }),
  filter((_, query) => query.length > 2),
  debounce(200),
  mutate(async ({ state, effects }, query) => {
    state.isSearching = true
    state.searchResult = await effects.getSearchResult(query)
    state.isSearching = false
  })
)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Statemachines" %}
```typescript
export const state = statemachine({
  unauthenticated: ['authenticating'],
  authenticating: ['unauthenticated', 'authenticated'],
  authenticated: ['unauthenticating'],
  unauthenticating: ['unauthenticated', 'authenticated']
}, {
  state: 'unauthenticated',
  user: null,
  error: null
})
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Class state" %}
```javascript
class LoginForm() {
  private username = ''
  private password = ''
  private validationError = ''
  changeUsername(username) {
    this.username = username
  }
  changePassword(password) {
    if (!password.match([0-9]) {
      this.validationError = 'You need some numbers in your password'
    }
    this.password = password
  }
  isValid() {
    return Boolean(this.username && this.password) 
  }
}

export const state = {
  loginForm: new LoginForm()
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## SNAPSHOT TESTING OF LOGIC

Bring in your application configuration of state, effects and actions. Create mocks for any effects. Take a snapshot of mutations performed in an action to ensure all intermediate states are met.

```javascript
import { createOvermindMock } from 'overmind'
import { config } from './'

test('should get items', async () => {
  const overmind = createOvermindMock(config, {
    api: {
      fetchItems: () => Promise.resolve([{ id: 0, title: "foo" }])
    }
  })

  await overmind.actions.getItems()

  expect(overmind.mutations).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

## WE WROTE THE TYPING

Overmind has you covered on typing. If you choose to use Typescript the whole API is built for excellent typing support. You will not spend time telling Typescript how your app works, Typescript will tell you!

## RUNNING CODESANDBOX

![](.gitbook/assets/256x256.png)

Overmind is running the main application of [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io). Codesandbox, with its state and effects complexity, benefits greatly combining Overmind and Typescript.
