# How to learn

To learn any new tool it is important to have some goal unrelated to the tool itself. Maybe you have a pet project or a project at work you want to try it on. There is a lot on the menu on the left here, so let us give you some pointers to the most important docs to understand Overmind.

* \*\*\*\*[**The the introduction video**](https://youtu.be/82Aq_ujnBQw) ****gives you a quick overview of what Overmind is
* You will benefit from getting into the overall structure with [**Configuration**](core/structuring-the-app.md)**,** then moving on to the specific concepts of [**State**](core/defining-state.md)**,** [**Actions**](core/writing-application-logic.md) ****and [**Effects**](core/running-side-effects.md)\*\*\*\*
* If you use Typescript it can be a good idea to already now explore how you use Overmind with [**Typescript**](core/typescript.md)\*\*\*\*
* Ready to start building something? Check of the view packages for [**React**](addons/react.md), [**Angular**](addons/angular.md) or [**Vue**](addons/vue.md), to get you started
* Once you got a feel for it, the **Connecting components** guide will give you some more insight into how you use your state in the components
* From here it is totally up to you! Good luck and please visit our Discord channel for support
