# How to learn

To learn any new tool it is important to have some goal unrelated to the tool itself. Maybe you have a pet project or a project at work you want to try it on. There is a lot on the menu on the left here, so let us give you some pointers to the most important docs to understand Overmind.

* \*\*\*\*[**The introduction video**](https://youtu.be/82Aq_ujnBQw) ****gives you a quick overview of what Overmind is
* You will benefit from getting into the overall structure with [**Configuration**](core/structuring-the-app.md)**,** then moving on to the specific concepts of [**State**](core/defining-state.md)**,** [**Actions**](core/writing-application-logic.md) ****and [**Effects**](core/running-side-effects.md)\*\*\*\*
* If you use Typescript it can be a good idea to already now explore how you use Overmind with [**Typescript**](core/typescript.md)\*\*\*\*
* Ready to start building something? Check of the view packages for [**React**](views/react.md), [**Angular**](views/angular.md)**,** [**Vue**](views/vue.md) ****or [**Svelte**](views/svelte.md), to get you started
* Once you got a feel for it, the [**Connecting components**](guides-1/connecting-components.md) guide will give you some more insight into how you use your state in the components
* From here it is totally up to you! Good luck and please visit our Discord channel for support
